🎓 Face Recognition Attendance System

A Smart Attendance Management System using Face Recognition and AI, built with React.js for the frontend and FastAPI (Python) for the backend.

This project is designed as a Final Year MCA Project, focusing on modern web development, backend APIs, and AI integration.

🚀 Project Overview

Traditional attendance systems are time-consuming and prone to proxy attendance.
This system uses AI-based face recognition to automatically mark attendance using a camera, making the process secure, fast, and reliable.
